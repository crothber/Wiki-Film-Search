# Wiki Film Search

This project consists of a series of Information Retrieval assignments, the goal of which is to create a search tool for all articles in the Wikipeia category '2017 films'.

Currently, the project consists of a script to organize the Wikipedia articles into a structured JSON format, with fields for film title, director, producer, cast, release date, runtime, setting (location/time), and article text.

Further work on the project (the actual search module and interface) will be uploaded as they are completed.
